## Installation

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Usage
1. Make the script executable:

   ``` chmod +x get_public_ip.sh ```

2. Run the script

   ```./get_public_ip.sh```

3. Select a method from the presented list or choose to run all methods.

## How It Works
The script connects to specified online services and retrieves the public IP address as seen by these services. It can use different methods (curl, wget, host, dig) based on what's available on your system and the service you choose to query.

## Creating an Alias for Easy Use

To make the Public IP Address Retriever more convenient to use, you can set up an alias in your shell's profile file. This allows you to run the script using a short command. Here's how to set it up:

### For Bash Users

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor. You can use editors like `nano` or `vim`:

```nano ~/.bashrc```

2. Add the following line at the end of the `.bashrc` file, replacing `/path/to/get_public_ip.sh` with the actual path to the script:

```alias getip='/path/to/get_public_ip.sh'```

3. Save and close the file.

4. To apply the changes, source your `.bashrc` file:

```source ~/.bashrc```

5. Now, you can simply type `getip` in your terminal to run the Public IP Address Retriever.

### For Zsh Users

If you're using Zsh, the process is similar, but you'll edit your `.zshrc` file.
